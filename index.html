        <p>
        Hi friends, welcome to my website! If you don't know me already, my name is Adam Wu and I am
        currently a third year student in University of California, Santa Cruz, majoring in computer
        engineering. I have interests in computer hardwares (mainly how they are built and how they
        can be improved for future technology), and hopefully be able to engineer a hardware parts
        in the future!  
        </p>
        <p>
        Feel free to look around my website for other things I have done or am currenlty working on!
        </p>

                <q>An engineer will need to learn computer languages that they weren't taught in college.
                It's easier to learn a new language when you know how computer languages are put
                together.</q> ~ Professor Kerry Veenstra
