        <p>
        Hi friends, welcome to my website! If you don't know me already, my name is Adam Wu and I am
        currently a third year student in University of California, Santa Cruz, majoring in computer
        engineering. I have interests in computer hardwares (mainly how they are built and how they
        can be improved for future technology), and hopefully be able to engineer a hardware parts
        in the future!  
        </p>
